"""Weather events: composing the prompt swap for the (skin | weather) state.

There is no weather LoRA. Weather uses the plain two-prompt edit-guidance
mechanism (the PR #431 ``replace_text`` path: the old prompt anchors the
scene, the flow is pushed along the new-minus-old text direction) to LAND
the state (guidance scale 2.5 over a short landing window), then holds
unguided: the weather persists through the KV history and the swapped
cross-attention text, so the steady-state cost of an active weather is a
single forward per step ("land-then-release", A/B'd 2026-08-21). Because
the transformer
routes any guided swap through the pre-merged text-edit LoRA when one is
attached, weather swaps must *bypass* the LoRA (it was trained on the four
style prompts, not weather); :class:`~.style_ability.StyleAbility` detaches
it around the ``replace_text`` call when ``use_lora`` is False.

Weather is a **base-world-only** ability (design decision 2026-08-20):
skin+weather combinations produced rain that was not attributable as rain
under the neon skins, so :class:`~.style_ability.StyleAbility` rejects the
weather key while a skin is active and clears weather when a skin is
activated. Weather text is appended to the authored map prompt and runtime map
context. Exactly one of (skin, weather) is active at any time:

===========  ==========  ==============================  ========  =========
skin         weather     prompt                          LoRA      corrector
===========  ==========  ==============================  ========  =========
none         none        base scene + map context        off       off
active       none        skin prompt + map context        on        style gain
none         active      base + map + weather suffix      BYPASS    weather gain*
===========  ==========  ==============================  ========  =========

``*`` the corrector gate profile was calibrated on style v6, not weather;
``LiveEditWeatherConfig.corrector_gain`` defaults to 0 (off) and can be
raised to a small absolute gain (e.g. 0.10) if base-world drift under a
long weather window proves worse than a mild corrector wash.
