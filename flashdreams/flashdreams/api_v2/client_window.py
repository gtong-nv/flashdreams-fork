    The runtime opens the window with a session's description, then reads input

    reset/replacement. A window may be opened/closed by the runtime during a session
    reset/replacement.

    A window does not describe the output shape. The session does, and the window
    is given that description in :meth:`OutputSink.open`.

    One thread makes every call on a window, so an implementation needs no
    locking except when its backend delivers input from another thread.
